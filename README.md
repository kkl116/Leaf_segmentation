# Leaf segmentation project 2019

This project was to create a pipeline for the segmentation of leaves and leaf lesions using the fastai api. The aim is to allow quantitative measurement
of lesion sizes and degree of chlorosis (leaf greenness), and hence quantitative analysis of plant disease progression. The pipeline is incorporated 
into a jupyter notebook, where different settings can be set (e.g. for grouping leaves in an image), and the deep learning models can be used by just 
feeding in image paths. Batch image processing is also supported. The fastai model files are not included!
